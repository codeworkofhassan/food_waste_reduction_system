I have placed latest database backup (fwms.sql) in folder named "database".

Please create new database named "fwms" on MySQL and then through Import tab, import my file (fwms.sql)..All of my data will be loaded on your PC.

When you will put my code in your localhost directory and run it, you will be directed to login page.

For Login Purpose:

Username: hassan
Password: 123

However, a new user can also be created by click on Register Link

And please make sure that device is connected to Internet, because I have used Bootstrap CDN.


Thank you,


Regards,
Hassan Zahid
